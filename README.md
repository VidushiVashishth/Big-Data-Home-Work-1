# Big-Data-Home-Work-1

This repository contains code for the programming assignment of Big Data course CS-6220-A
The option chosen for this homework was problem 3.1


This codebase contains 2 jupyter notebooks:
- Vidushi_Vashishth_Big_Data_HW1: contains code for run on CPU+GPU on M1 chip with data complexity variation
- Vidushi_Vashishth_Big_Data_HW1_Varying_k: contains code for run on CPU+GPU on M1 chip with model complexity variation and outlier comparison

Results.numbers contains the metrices computed for each scenario in tabular form.


# Setup details:
- Installed miniconda suited for the arm architecture.
- Created a conda environment for this home work. Installed all dependencies including tensorflow in this env.
- To enable tensorflow to use GPU on M1 chip air, apple's tensorflow installation needs to be used. I followed the steps in this repo to setup my environment:
