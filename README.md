# Big-Data-Home-Work-1

This repository contains code for the programming assignment of Big Data course CS-6220-A
The option chosen for this homework was problem 3.1


This codebase contains 3 jupyter notebooks:
- Vidushi_Vashishth_Big_Data_HW1: contains code for run on CPU+GPU on M1 chip with data complexity variation
- Vidushi_Vashishth_Big_Data_HW1_Varying_k: contains code for run on CPU+GPU on M1 chip with model complexity variation and outlier comparison

Results.numbers contains the metrices computed for each scenario in tabular form.
